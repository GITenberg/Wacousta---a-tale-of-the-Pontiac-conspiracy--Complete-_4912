description: "Wacousta is a novel by John Richardson. Published in 1832, it is sometimes\
  \ claimed as the first Canadian novel, although in fact it is preceded by Julia\
  \ Catherine Beckwith's St Ursula's Convent; or, The Nun of Canada (Kingston, 1824).\
  \ Wacousta is better categorized as the first attempt by a Canadian-born author\
  \ at historical fiction.\nHowever, it is one of the first novels written by a Canadian-born\
  \ author about Canada, and, in spite of its overwrought sentimentalism, it has been\
  \ treated as a seminal work in the development of a Canadian literary sensibility.\n\
  Its themes include prophecy and opposites, such as manliness vs. effeminacy, wilderness/wildness\
  \ vs. civilization, sensibility vs. compassion and the natural vs. the supernatural\
  \ among others.\nIn the period of publication, Wacousta was quite popular not only\
  \ in Canada, but also in the United States. A contemporary novel it competed with\
  \ was James Fenimore Cooper's The Last of the Mohicans. Where they differ is that\
  \ Cooper's novel focuses on the efforts of the individual within the whole, but\
  \ Richardson's novel concerns itself with broader cross-cultural motivations.\n\
